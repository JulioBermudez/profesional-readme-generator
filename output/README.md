  ## Licence
  Your relationship with IBM is governed by several agreements which set out what is expected in terms of use of our software. These agreements are supplemented by offering-specific documents which set out the licensing terms in more detail. By installing and/or using IBM software, you agree to these terms.
    The licensing terms typically relate to how much of the software you can use, how and when you can use it, and/or who can use it. However, there are many other important terms set out in the agreements on matters such as:
    Use restrictions (for example, territories, purpose of use)
    Transfers and change of ownership
    Term of the agreement
    Pricing
    Verification
    One of the most important aspects of IBM licensing is the measurement of the license metric. This measurement counts your deployment and/or use of the product.
